## Change Logs

### Performance

In our attempt to remediate screens lock outs, it looks like K9s performance on certain clusters took a major dive. In this drop we've taken a peek at improving some of the perf issues tho much more investigating does remain. Big ATTA Boys! in effect this week to @eldada and @despairblue for kind support in helping me track down some of these issues. We're not done yet but hopefully this drop will be a bit of an improvement in the 0.6.x lineage. Thank you all for your patience and support!!
