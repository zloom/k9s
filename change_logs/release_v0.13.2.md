### XRay Reloaded. Part Duh!

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/derailed/k9s/master/assets/k9s_xray.png"/>

Found a waffle thin issue in the Beryllium(Be) core causing K9s xray vision to only operate on one eye ;)
Should be all betta' now...

The `xray` command now takes an **optional** third argument for the target namespace ie `:xray dp fred` will show the Xray view for deployments in the `fred` namespace.

Supported resources:

* Pods
* Deployments
* Services
* StatefulSets
* DaemonSets
* ReplicaSets

Still watch out for that overbite!! hence please proceed with caution...
