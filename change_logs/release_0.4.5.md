## Change Logs

### Multi containers

  There was an [issue](https://github.com/zloom/k9s/issues/135) where we ran into limitations with the container
  selection keyboard shortcuts only allowing up to 10 containers. In this release, we've changed to a pick list vs the menu
  to select containers for both shell and logs access. This gives K9s the ability to select up to 26 containers now. This
  is not in any way an *encouragement* to have so many containers per pods!!

### Alias View ShortCut

  The change above entailed having to move the alias shortcut to `A` vs `a` as the pick list shortcuts conflicted with
  the alias view keyboard activation.
