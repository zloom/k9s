### Bow Or Stern?

Some of you had voiced wanting to enable the multi pod logger [Stern](https://github.com/wercker/stern) from the good folks at [Wercker](https://github.com/wercker). Well now you can!

To make this work the awesome [Tuomo Syvänperä](https://github.com/syvanpera) contributed a PR to enable to plug this in with K9s. Thank you Tuomo!!
By default the filter will be set to the currently selected pod. If you need to change the filter, simply filter the pod view to using your own regex and that's the filter K9s will use. Here is a sample plugin that defines a new K9s shortcut to launch Stern provided of course it is installed on your box...

```yaml
# K9s plugin.yml
plugin:
  stern:
    shortCut: Ctrl-L
    description: "Logs (Stern)"
    scopes:
      - pods
    command: /usr/local/bin/stern # NOTE! Look for the command at this location.
    background: false
    args:
    - --tail
    - 50
    - $FILTER # NOTE! Pulls the filter out of the pod view.
    - -n
    - $NAMESPACE
    - --context
    - $CONTEXT
```
