NOTE: I am one not to pressure folks into giving. However, it does make me sad to see postings out there with clear indications that K9s is being used and yet zero mentions of the web site nor this repo. K9s marketing budget relies entirely on word of mouth and is not pimped out by big corps. So if you publish your work and leverage K9s, please give us a shoutout or at the very least reference this repo or website!

## AutoSuggestions

K9s command mode now provides for auto complete. Suggestions are pulled from available kubernetes resources and custom aliases. The command mode supports the following keyboard triggers:

| Key                 | Description                              |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------|
| ‚¨ÜÔ∏è ‚¨áÔ∏è               | Navigate up or down thru the suggestions |
| `Ctrl-w`, `Ctrl-u`  | Clear out the command                    |
| `Tab`, `Ctrl-f`, ‚û°Ô∏è | Accept the suggestion                    |

## Logs Revisited

Breaking Change! This drop changes how logs are viewed and configured. The log view now support for pulling logs based on the log timeline current settings are: all, 1m, 5m, 15m and 1h. The following log configuration is in effect as of this drop:

```yaml
# $HOME/.k9s/config.yml
k9s:
  refreshRate: 2
  readOnly: false
  # NOTE: New logger configuration!
  logger:
    tail:          200 # Tail the last 100 lines. Default 100
    buffer:       5000 # Max number of lines displayed in the view. Default 1000
    sinceSeconds:  900 # Displays the last x seconds from the logs timeline. Default 5m
  ...
```
