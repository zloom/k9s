## Change Logs

### AfterMath

Looks like I've broken some stuff in the excitement of 0.7.0! As I ran thru the video this am, I noticed the last minute screen dumps might not be a viable feature. As [Norbert](https://github.com/ncsibra) correctly points out, in issue #187 (Thanks Norbert!!), retrieving screen dumps was a pain. So I've put together a quick ScreenDump view alias `sd` to view the screen snapshots and allows to pop your editor of choice upon selection to view the screen dump file content.

NOTE: You will need to use an EDITOR env var to tell K9s which editor you want to use.

```shell
# For example...
export EDITOR=vim
```

This is a quick turn around, hopefully I did not hose anything else in the process ;(
