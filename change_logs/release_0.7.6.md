## Change Logs

### MultiLogs Initial Support

This is an experimental enhancement to allow to view logs for associated resources ie view logs for all containers in a pod or view container logs for pods fronted by a service, deployment, etc... directly in K9s. We've contemplated integrating the excellent `stern` CLI for this which is more full featured than the current implementation, but decided that shelling out for logs was at this juncture not ideal. Based on your feedback, we might revisit in future releases should this feature be a total dud...

### Delete Dialog

The resource delete dialog was updated to provide affordance for force and cascade deletes. This should now provide an on par behavior with the `kubectl` CLI. Cascade and force options are checkboxes, please use `<ENTER>` to toggle the flags.
