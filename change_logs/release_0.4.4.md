## Change Logs

### Exiting K9s

  There are a few debates about drathers on K9s key bindings. I have caved in
  and decided to give up my beloved 'q' for quit which will no longer be bound. As of this release quitting K9s must be done via `:q` or `ctrl-c`.

### Container Logs

  [Feature #147](https://github.com/zloom/k9s/issues/147). The default behavior was to pick the first available container. Which meant if the pod has an init container, the log view would choose that.
  The view will now choose the first non init container. Most likely it
  would be the wrong choice in pod's sidecar scenarios, but for the time
  being showing log on one of the init containers just did not make much sense. You can still pick other containers via the menu options. We will implement a better solution for this soon...

### Delete Dialog

  [Feature #146](https://github.com/zloom/k9s/issues/146) Tx @dperique!
  Pressing `<enter>` on the delete dialog would delete the resource. Now
  `cancel` is the default button. Hence you must use `<tab>` or `->` to
  select `OK` then press `<enter>` to delete.
