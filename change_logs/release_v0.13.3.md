### XRay Now With Lipstick?

Call me old school, but Xray without icons made me a bit sad ;( Just like any engineer would, I do fancy eye candy once in a while...
So I've decided to revive the xray `icon` mode for the some of us that are not stuck with what I'd like to call `Jurassic` terminals.
To date, there was no way to skin the Xray view, so I've added a new xray skin config section that `currently` looks like this:

```yaml
# $HOME/.k9s/skin.yml
k9s:
  body:
    fgColor: dodgerblue
    bgColor: black
    logoColor: orange
  ...
  xray:
      fgColor: blue
      bgColor: black
      cursorColor: aqua
      graphicColor: darkgoldenrod
      # NOTE! Show xray in icon mode. Defaults to false!!
      showIcons: true
```

So if your terminal does not support emoji's we're still cool...
